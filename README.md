# Sweepline Demo

This page is meant to be a demonstration of sweepline. You can initialize some number of lines from 1 to 20. The "Process event" line lets you step through the algorithm while "Run fully" runs the entire algorithm from start to finish. You can also toggle options for displaying various parts of the algorithm.
